In general, the work has been divided between front end and back end, with Sebastian Quiros and Haider Malik focusing on the development of the backend (Server functionality, database with SQL_lite, account creation logic), while Diego Romero and Loveneek Singh have implemented the GUI for the frontend, with all the different tab functionality, email contact form and connection to the backend involved. The team has collaborated together to make the project functional, and work has been divided equally among team members based on each member's background knowledge and preference.

While most tasks where originally planned to be completed between 2-5 days, most of the work has been developed continuously in the lapse of 2 weeks, with constant updates and modifictions taking place between branches before being merged to the main branch.
